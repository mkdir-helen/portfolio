                    I used to think science was my thing when I studied Biology in college. It wasn't really. 
                    I didn't hate, it but I never felt enough passion to mingle in a party of science lovers or push myself to take a new learning challenge.
                    After a few years, I decided to switch to a different field--Professional and Technical Writing. 
                    I really enjoyed learning about the specific designs and grammar rules that create a better user experience. 
                    It excited me to think that one change of a specific element on a page can instantly transform the art to be ugly or beautiful.
                    However, I felt there was still something missing. I either felt my creativity was limited to the rules set often by opinions of professionals or users;
                    or sometimes I did not have enough creativity to develop a new enhanced user experience (basic rules of designs and grammar have remained unchanged for decades).

                    One day, while I was browsing through tutorials on Photoshop, I came across courses on how to code websites. 
                    I decided to give learning to build websites a try and I instantly fell in love with the world of coding.
                    The coding language gives me the kind of satisfaction similar to when you finish fitting the puzzle pieces together, 
                    except it's different in that there is an unlimited supply of puzzle pieces; 
                    it's up to your creative instinct as to how to organize or pick the right pieces--whether it's trending or fits "just right."
